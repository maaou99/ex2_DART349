   <p>This website showcases villa properties in Dubai. The overall design is simplistic, yet
    the villas are presented as futuristic and modern. The website is straightforward to use,
    as it focuses on allowing users to view the properties and contact the company if they
    are interested. These two Call To Actions (CTAâ€™s) are prominently displayed on the
    homepage. The content has a luxurious feel, thanks to the font and the use of golden
    color. I believe this site is creative because it provides an immersive experience through
    sound and navigation.</p>
